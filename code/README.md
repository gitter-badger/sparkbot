# Code

## This directory contains the code intended to run on the Arduino nano.  The Arduino nano acts as the brawns for my robot, as it controls the Servos and the RGB lights.

The Arduino nano communicates with the Photon over serial.  It can can take direct commands like setting to states of different pins or reading pins, and or advanced commands like running a certain light show or dance.
