/*This firmware controls the arms and head movement using the two buttons on SparkBot's hands.  Whenever you press a button, the
corresponding arm moves either up or down, the moodlight system turns either red, blue or green randomly, and the head moves to a random
angle.  This firmware was released for SparkBot under the GPL licence.
