# Changes:

* Swapped 3v3 with VIN on the servos.  I am expecting this to supply the servos with > 4.5 volts.  I expect this to fix problems I was having with my servos.
* Removed the pins for attaching a 9V battery pack.
* Added pins to solder an external reset button.
* Cleaned up some connections.
