#PCB
######This directory contains all of the Fritzing PCB files, concept designs, and PDF images of all the SparkBot PCBs.

* Main/ - This is the Main Spark Photon shield PCB.
* Others/ - These are the other PCBs used for SparkBot.  They include the 2 Button + RGB PCBs for the hands, the RGB PCB for the head, and the Photoresistor PCB.
* Backpacks/ - **NEW UPDATE!** This folder contains the designs for SparkBot Backpacks, which plug in directly to the back of the robot, and are great expansion boards.
* PCB Sketch.pdf: This was the original design idea for the SparkBot shield.
