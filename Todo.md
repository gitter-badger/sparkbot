* Create a mimic program with two SparkBots.  When one SparkBot's servos move, the other SparkBot's changes.  The second SparkBot will mimic the RGB lights and movements of the first one.  This project will use the Spark.publish() and the Spark.subscribe() functions to quickly send commands between the two SparkBots.
