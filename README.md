# SparkBot: The IoT robotics kit for everyone
SparkBot is a kit designed for ages 12 and up that uses the Spark Photon.  Its goal is to teach basic robotics, Arduino programming skills, and REST API's in a fun and understandable way.
The purpose of SparkBot is to create a friendly robot frontend that will get people excited to program and make projects with.  All you need to use SparkBot is a computer and Wi-Fi.  The Photon is simply attached to the back of the robot through the connectors, and then plugged into the computer via USB.

The Photon is the SparkBot's brain.  It is programmed with the Spark.io web IDE, and can hold one program (firmware) at a time.
This repository contains the example code used in the book and other projects.

The Photon is attached to the back of the robot's body through the shield on its back.
###The SparkBot kit includes:
* 1 Spark Photon
* 1 Micro usb cable
* 1 Mini Breadboard  
* 1 Robot Body with Photon attachment shield
* 65 Assorted jumper wires
* 1 Protective travel case

####The Robot body includes the following components:
* 4 RGB led's (Eyes + Hands)
* 2 Buttons (Hands)
* 1 Buzzer (Mouth)
* 1 Temperature sensor (Body)
* 1 Microphone (Body)
* 1 Head Servo (Neck)
* 2 Arm Servos (Shoulders)

The SparkBot's body is composed of several 3D printed plastic parts.  I will release these soon.
The SparkBot is under the GPL license.  Anyone can use the schematics and code here or print the 3d model files.
