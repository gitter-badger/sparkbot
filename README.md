# SparkBot: The IoT robotics kit for everyone
SparkBot is a kit designed for programmers aged 12 and up that uses the Spark Photon.  Its goal is to teach basic robotics, Arduino programming skills, and REST API's in a fun and understandable way.

The purpose of SparkBot is to create a friendly robot frontend that will get people excited to program and make projects with.  All you need to use SparkBot is a computer and Wi-Fi.  The Photon is simply attached to the back of the robot through the connectors, and then plugged into the computer via USB.

The Photon is the SparkBot's brain.  It is programmed from the <a href="https://build.spark.io/">Spark.io web IDE</a>, and can be flashed with on project at a time (firmware).
