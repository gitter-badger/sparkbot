# <a href="http://sparkbot.co">SparkBot: The IoT robotics kit for everyone</a>
SparkBot is a kit designed for programmers aged 12 and up that uses the Photon by Particle.  Its goal is to teach basic robotics, Arduino programming skills, and REST APIs in a fun and understandable way.

The purpose of SparkBot is to create a friendly robot front-end that will get people excited to program and make projects with.  All you need to use SparkBot is a computer and Wi-Fi.  The Photon is simply attached to the back of the robot through the connectors, and then plugged into the computer via USB.

The Photon is the SparkBot's brain.  It is programmed from the <a href="https://build.particle.io/">Particle.io web IDE</a>, and can be flashed with one project at a time (firmware).


This repository contains the concept designs for SparkBot, the example code, the PCB designs and the components list, and it will later have the marketing plans and the user manual.

The SparkBot's body will be composed of several 3D printed plastic parts.  These .stl files will be released under the GPL License, so that anyone with their own 3D printer will be able to print their own custom SparkBot body.
